# GIF Creator

## Introduction

The GIF Creator Python script offers a versatile solution to generate GIF animations from either a video or an image file. This script is designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, providing a command-line interface for specifying input parameters and creating GIFs with customizable settings.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- MoviePy library (`pip install moviepy`)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `gif_creator.py` script.
2. Ensure all prerequisites are installed.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `gif_creator.py`.
5. Execute the script by running the following command:

    ```bash
    python gif_creator.py
    ```

6. Follow the prompts to select the file type (video or image) and provide the necessary input parameters.

## Command-Line Arguments

The script accepts the following command-line arguments:

- `file_type`: Specifies whether the GIF is to be created from a video or an image. Choose either 'video' or 'image'.
- `video_path` (if `file_type` is 'video'): Path to the input video file.
- `image_path` (if `file_type` is 'image'): Path to the input image file.
- `gif_path`: Path for the output GIF file.
- `start_time` (optional): Start time (in seconds) for the GIF (applicable only for video files).
- `end_time` (optional): End time (in seconds) for the GIF (applicable only for video files).
- `duration` (optional): Duration (in seconds) for each frame in the GIF (applicable only for image files).
- `fps`: Frame rate (frames per second) for the GIF.

## Example

To create a GIF from a video file:

```bash
python gif_creator.py
Enter the file type to create GIF from (video/image): video
Enter the path to the input video file: path/to/input_video.mp4
Enter the path for the output GIF file (e.g., output.gif): path/to/output.gif
Enter the start time (in seconds) for the GIF: 10
Enter the end time (in seconds) for the GIF (leave blank for full duration): 20
Enter the frame rate (frames per second) for the GIF: 10
```

To create a GIF from an image file:

```bash
python gif_creator.py
Enter the file type to create GIF from (video/image): image
Enter the path to the input image file: path/to/input_image.jpg
Enter the path for the output GIF file (e.g., output.gif): path/to/output.gif
Enter the duration (in seconds) for each frame in the GIF: 0.5
Enter the frame rate (frames per second) for the GIF: 10
```
